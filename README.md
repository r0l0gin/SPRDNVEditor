### Device Profile Management
1. Click "Manage Profiles" to open the profile manager
2. Create new profiles or edit existing ones
3. Configure NV base addresses, data sizes, and FDL files
4. Add flash file definitions for additional memory regions
5. Save profiles for reuse across sessions

### File Comparison
1. Click "Compare Files" to open the comparison dialog
2. Select two NV files using the Browse buttons
3. Click "Compare Files" to analyze differences
4. Review color-coded results:
   - ðŸŸ¢ **Green**: Identical items
   - ðŸ”´ **Red**: Different values
   - ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow**: Only in first file
   - ðŸ”µ **Blue**: Only in second file

### Flash File Reading
1. Configure flash file definitions in device profiles
2. Use "Read Flash Files" for standalone flash reading
3. Files are automatically organized in timestamped folders

## Configuration

### Device Profiles
Device profiles are stored as JSON files in the `Profiles` directory. Each profile contains:

```json
{
  "Name": "device",
  "Description": "Profile for device",
  "NVBaseAddress": 2415919105,
  "NVDataSize": 723880,
  "Fdl1Data": "base64-encoded-fdl1-data",
  "Fdl2Data": "base64-encoded-fdl2-data",
  "FlashFiles": [
    {
      "Name": "Bootloader",
      "Description": "Device bootloader region",
      "BaseAddress": 2147483648,
      "Size": 65536,
      "FileName": "bootloader.bin",
      "Enabled": true
    }
  ],
  "NVItemMappings": {
    "NV_0001": {
      "Id": 1,
      "Name": "IMEI1",
      "Description": "Primary IMEI",
      "Type": "IMEI",
      "Size": 15
    }
  }
}
```

### Memory Layout
- **NV Base Address**: 0x90000001 (virtual address for NV parameters)
- **NV Memory Size**: 0x0B0BA8 bytes (723,880 bytes total)
- **Read Chunk Size**: 12KB for efficient transfer
- **Protocol**: SPRD boot mode with CRC32 validation

## Development

### Architecture
The application follows a modular architecture:

- **MainForm.cs**: Main UI orchestration and user interactions
- **SPRDNVToolInternal.cs**: Low-level device communication and protocol handling
- **NVParser.cs**: NV parameter parsing and data type management
- **DeviceProfileManager.cs**: Profile management and persistence
- **USBFastConnect.cs**: USB device detection and connection management

### Key Components
- **Device Communication**: HDLC protocol implementation for SPRD devices
- **Data Parsing**: Flexible type system with custom formatting support
- **Profile System**: JSON-based configuration with automatic migration
- **UI Framework**: Windows Forms with custom hex editor control

### Testing
```bash
# Run unit tests
dotnet test

# Build and test
dotnet build && dotnet test
```

## Protocol Details

For comprehensive technical information about the SPRD device communication protocol, including HDLC framing, command structures, and implementation details, see [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md).

### SPRD Boot Mode Communication
1. **Device Detection**: Automatic detection of devices in boot mode
2. **FDL Loading**: Sequential loading of FDL1 and FDL2 bootloaders
3. **Memory Access**: Direct memory read/write operations
4. **Mode Switching**: Automatic switching between boot and diagnostic modes

### NV Parameter Structure
- **Header**: Magic numbers and size information
- **Items**: Variable-length records with ID, length, and data
- **Checksum**: CRC32 validation for data integrity

### Development Guidelines
- Follow C# coding conventions
- Add unit tests for new functionality
- Update documentation for API changes
- Ensure compatibility with existing profiles

## Safety and Security

### Data Safety
- **Backup Recommended**: Always backup original NV parameters before modification
- **Validation**: Parameter bounds checking and type validation
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Write operations require user confirmation

### Device Protection
- **CRC Validation**: Prevents data corruption during transfers
- **Chunked Operations**: Reduces memory stress on device
- **State Management**: Automatic recovery from protocol errors

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Device Not Detected**
- Ensure SPRD device drivers are installed
- Check USB cable and connection
- Verify device is in boot mode

**Communication Errors**
- Try different COM port
- Restart application and reconnect device
- Check FDL files are present and valid

**Profile Loading Errors**
- Verify JSON syntax in profile files
- Ensure FDL files exist at specified paths
- Check file permissions

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting environment variable:
```
SET SPRDNV_DEBUG=1
```
